		<p>Merilu Pizza Al Metro is a quaint little pizzeria in the heart of Hell's Kitchen. Serving a thin crust pizza with its recipe's origin from Merilu's home town of Torino, Italy, all of the food at Merilu's - from salads to pasta to tiramisu - is made with family pride and years of experience. Merilu's smile and inviting nature with guests will make you feel as though you're in mom's embrace - and you know you'll never leave mom's with an empty stomach! Pizza Al Metro is their signature Pizza and it is quite tasty, with their homemade, hand pulled fresh mozzarella. I fell in love!  Their fresh ingredients is tasted in every bite. Their most popular are - Italian Vegetariana, Rustica & Lou's Spicy Buffalo Chicken... those are just a few of the many on the list! And people can create there own pizza al metro!!!</p>

		<p>The Pizzeria is located at 791 9th Ave., which is located right around the corner from the library where we take our coding classes. What a way to spend an hour lunch break with a quick bite New York NY, 10019. Merilu's is very small but the service was outstanding. </p>
