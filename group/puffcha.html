        <!--This is the beginning of the description of everything about the restaurant-->
        <p> Puff Cha is a small, but adorable authentic Thai resaurant on West 50th Street between 9th and 10th Avenues. 
        The decor is modern, bright, and fun. The main art feature is a hand drawn and painted mural of a Thai landscape 
        of river boats and architecture typical to that region. 
        </p>
        
        <p> Their menu consists of Thai salads, soups, noodles (Pad Thai is the most widely known), and main entree dishes 
        (mostly pork and chicken based). They're best known for their variety of, "puffs." If you haven't had a puff 
        before in any other Thai restaurants (most only have one or two options), think of them as softer empanadas, 
        or fried and more doughy dumplings. My favorite dish has been their Curry Pork Ramen under their Lunch Special menu. 
        It comes with iced tea, a small salad with peanut dressing (lettuce, carrots, and tomatoes) and 2 fried vegetable 
        spring rolls. The main dish comes with noodles, curry broth, pork slices, and is topped with scallions, bamboo shoots, 
        carrots and corn. ramen is nice and chewy. The curry broth is sweet, light and good flavor depth. Face value is $7.50. 
        With tax and tip comes out to $10.00 (fluctuates depending on how generous you are that day). </p>
