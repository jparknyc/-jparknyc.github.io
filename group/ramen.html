		<p>Totto Ramen is a restaurant that serves ramen noodle soups and other small bites. There are locations in New York City, Boston, and Taipei. The menu is minimalist. There are four types of ramen offered at all locations. There are special ramen, which have availability depending on location. Appetizers, a variety of soup toppings, and beverages (non-alcoholic and alcoholic) are also served. The ramen is very budget friendly and starts at $11.</p>

		<p>I visited the Hell's Kitchen location on 51st Street between 9th and 10th Avenues, which is right around the corner from the Columbus Library. This location has counter seating and tables that seat 2-4 people. It was only an hour and a half into lunch time, but there was a small line. The counter had space available and I was seated there. At the counter, chopsticks are stored in open canisters so you can help yourself to utensils. The menu shows pictures of the food so you know what your ramen will look like. The ramen comes with a choice of pork or chicken and there is a vegetable ramen option.</p>

		<p>I decided to try the Miso Paitan with pork. This ramen comes topped with miso, bean sprouts, onion, scallions, ground pork, and a half-boiled egg. The miso tasted sweet and salty. The broth tasted heavy and creamy. The broth alone is very filling. It is especially good for the winter months, but I'm not so sure about eating this reamen in warmer weather. The only caveat is the onion. It had a very strong flavor. The taste was so strong, I wished I had some gum or mints to chew on after my meal. Nonetheless, I loved my choice.</p>

		<p>The base price for the Miso Paitan Ramen is $12. I drank water for my beverage. After tax and tip, I spent about $16. I say it's worth the price. Another caveat is payment. All locations of Totto Ramen only accept cash.</p>

		<p>Good ramen is hard to find. I would come here again despite the crowd. Also, the Midtown West location is just two blocks away, too.</p>
