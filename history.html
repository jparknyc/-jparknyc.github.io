<div class="main"> 
    <p> Pizza has been around since the neolithic age when people added other ingredients to bread in order to make it more appetizing.</p>

    <p>Ancient Greeks would make a flat bread called plakous with toppings such as garlic, onions,  and herbs.
    Persian armies baked flatbreads with cheese and dates on top of their battle shields as far back as the 6th century BC.
    </p>

    <p>In Naples, starting in the 16th-century, people started to refer to a galette flatbread as "pizza." Sold as a street food, it was known as the dish the poor. The variety of topping changed over time and was later replaced by oil, tomatoes, and fish. A legend details that in June 1889, to honour the Queen Margherita of Savoy from Italy, a Neapolitan pizzamaker named Raffaele Esposito created what he called the "Pizza Margherita." This pizza is still made to this day with tomatoes, mozzarella, and basil, which represent the national colours of Italy (on the Italian flag).</p>

    <p>Now, pizza is frequently topped with tomatoes and cheese. It's a favorite of college students, both the poor and rich, and of the creator of this website. 1 in 8 Americans eat pizza on a given day with over 350 slices being eaten every second! </p>
