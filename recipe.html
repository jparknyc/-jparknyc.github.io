    <h1> Easy Pizza Dough Recipe</h1>
    <h3> Total Time: 1.5 hours </h3>
    <h3> Makes 2 x 14" pizza crusts </h3>
    <h2> Ingredients </h2>
    <p>&#9744; 3 1/2 to 4 cups bread flour, plus more for rolling 
    </p>
    <p> &#9744; 1 teaspoon sugar </p>
    <p>&#9744; 1 envelope instant dry yeast </p>
    <p>&#9744; 2 teaspoons kosher salt </p>
    <p>&#9744; 1 1/2 cups water, 110 degrees F </p>
    <p>&#9744; 2 tablespoons olive oil, plus 2 teaspoons </p>

    <h2> Instructions</h2>
    <p> Combine the bread flour, sugar, yeast and kosher salt in the bowl of a stand mixer and combine. While the mixer is running, add the water and 2 tablespoons of the oil and beat until the dough forms into a ball. If the dough is sticky, add additional flour, 1 tablespoon at a time, until the dough comes together in a solid ball. If the dough is too dry, add additional water, 1 tablespoon at a time. Scrape the dough onto a lightly floured surface and gently knead into a smooth, firm ball.</p>

    <p>Grease a large bowl with the remaining 2 teaspoons olive oil, add the dough, cover the bowl with plastic wrap and put it in a warm area to let it double in size, about 1 hour. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and divide it into 2 equal pieces. Cover each with a clean kitchen towel or plastic wrap and let them rest for 10 minutes.</p>
